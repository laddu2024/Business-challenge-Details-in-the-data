Business challenge: Details in the data

In this activity, you apply what you've learned about
Google Sheets to help Sherrie West and the team at
On the Rise Bakery solve a business challenge.

Task 1

Sherrie informs you that she has recently collected numbers from On the Rise stores across the globe
and added them to a spreadsheet.
Sherrie asks for your help. She wants to analyze the data to better understand the current
and future employment situation at On the Rise. She also hopes to share her findings and
collaborate with the On the Rise leadership team. To achieve these goals, Sherrie needs your
help to leverage the power of Google Sheets.
Complete the following steps:
1. Open the spreadsheet On the Rise employee openings – North America – East region.
Make a copy to My Drive when prompted.
2. Rename your copy with your first and last name to read: “On the Rise employee
openings_YOURNAME.”
3. Star the Google Sheet.


Task 2

You inform Sherrie that you’ve renamed and starred the spreadsheet to make it easy to locate
in Google Drive.
Sherrie thanks and tells you she recently received an update from On the Rise Fort
Lauderdale store owner Yousef Amadi. Yousef just uploaded a new Google Sheet with
employment data from his location. He has named the Sheet “On the Rise employee openings
– Ft. Lauderdale.”
Sherrie requests that you add Yousef's data to her main spreadsheet.
Later, Sherrie informs you that unfortunately On the Rise store Charleston has closed
permanently. She asks you to remove that store's data from the spreadsheet.
Complete the following steps:
1. Open your Google Sheet “On the Rise employee openings_YOURNAME.”
2. Then, open On the Rise employee openings - Ft Lauderdale and copy the values found
in Row 4.
3. Paste the data from Row 4 in the Ft Lauderdale Sheet into a new row, Row 21 in “On
the Rise employment openings_YOURNAME.” Select Paste special and choose
Values only to paste only the numeric values and none of the formatting from the
spreadsheet of Yousef.
4. Select the row containing the Charleston data and delete it.
5. Close the “On the Rise employee openings - Ft Lauderdale” tab.

Task 3

In order to help Sherrie make “On the Rise employee openings_YOURNAME” easier to
navigate, you offer to make some formatting changes. You freeze the header, merge ranges to
eliminate duplication. You also wrap text, align data, add colors to differentiate each quarter,
and color the borders.
Complete the following steps:
1. Freeze the header of the spreadsheet.
a. Select Row 3.
b. From the View menu, select Freeze and choose Up to current row.
2. Merge the ranges that follow. Select the cells and from the Format menu select
Merge cells and choose Merge all.
a. Employee Openings C1:N1
b. Actual C2:H2
c. Forecast I2:N2
3. Select Column A. From the Format menu, select Text wrapping, and choose Wrap.
4. Resize columns K, M, and N. Select the column, right-click, select Resize column, and
choose Fit to data.
5. Select B1:N20. From the Format menu, select Align, and choose Center and Middle.
6. Make each quarter a different color. Select the range, Fill color, and choose the
following colors:
a. Q1 (C4:E20) choose light yellow 3.
b. Q2 (F4:H20) choose light yellow 2.
c. Q3 (I4:K20) choose light blue 3.
d. Q4 (L4:N20) choose light blue 2.
7. Make the cell borders dark gray.
a. Select cells A1:N20.
b. Select Borders.
c. Choose All borders.
d. Choose Dark gray 3.

Task 4

Sherrie is still having a difficult time with the data, so you offer to make some more updates to
make the Sheet easier to navigate.
Start by sorting data by city A > Z. Next, filter the entries by state. Then, name each range
after the corresponding month.
Complete the following steps:
1. Sort the data by city.
a. Select Column A.
b. Select the down arrow and choose Sort sheet A → Z.
2. Set up a filter by state.
a. Select Column B.
b. From the top menu, select Create a filter.
c. Try filtering by state. How many stores are in New York? Pennsylvania?
d. Reset the filter to show all states.
3. Name a range for each month. Select the range, right-click, and select Define the
named range.
a. C4:C20 “Jan”
b. D4:D20 “Feb”
c. E4:E20 “Mar”
d. F4:F20 “Apr”
e. G4:G20 “May”
f. H4:H20 “Jun”
g. I4:I20 “Jul”
h. J4:J20 “Aug”
i. K4:K20 “Sep”
j. L4:L20 “Oct”
k. M4:M20 “Nov”
l. N4:N20 “Dec"

Task 5

Next, to help Sherrie better understand what is happening each month and over the year as a
whole, you apply two formulas: SUM and AVERAGE. You tell Sherrie that naming the ranges
helps simplify the formulas.
You use a SUM formula to calculate the total job openings for each month. You then combine
all the monthly totals to calculate the total job vacancies for the year.
To determine which stores are experiencing the most turnover, you calculate the yearly
average of job openings per store. You apply the AVERAGE formula to each On the Rise
location.
Complete the following steps:
1. In cell A21, enter “Total.”
2. Calculate the total job openings per month using a SUM formula and your named
ranges.
a. For January, apply the formula C21=sum(Jan)
b. For February, apply the formula D21=sum(Feb)
c. For March, apply the formula E21=sum(Mar)
d. Complete similarly for the remaining months.
3. In cell O3, enter “Average.”
4. Calculate the yearly average of job openings per store by applying the AVERAGE
formula to column O.
a. For Albany, apply the formula O4 =average(C4:N4)
b. Double-click the bottom right corner of cell O4 or drag the bottom-right corner
of cell O4 to O20 to reveal averages for all cities.
c. Select column O, and from the toolbar, choose Decrease decimal places to
round values in this column to one decimal place.
5. Bold Row 21, and Column O.
6. Select C21:O21. From the Format menu, select Align, and choose Center and Middle.
7. Repeat step 6 for Column 0.

Task 6
Sherrie tells you she shares the spreadsheet with the On the Rise leadership team soon. She
is concerned about accidental data changes and wants to make sure current store data is
protected. She’d like Thomas to be able to make updates if necessary, so you assign him as
an editor for the protected range.
Complete the following steps:
1. From the Data menu, choose Protect sheets and ranges.
2. Enter a description, and select Range and choose C4:N20.
3. Select Set permissions. Choose Restrict who can edit this range and Custom.
4. Add Thomas Omar as an editor. In this case though, add your instructor’s email
address.
5. Click Done.
6. Click Share to grant your instructor editor access to the spreadsheet.


Task 7

1. Share the spreadsheet with the leadership team (choose another colleague, and let
them know as before that you are undertaking a training exercise) as a Commenter. To
share silently, you can uncheck the Notify people box when sharing.
Next, you will play the part of someone on the leadership team.
2. Leave at least two general comments.
3. Assign an action item to yourself or one of your collaborators.
A few days later, Sherrie informs you that she is ready to share the spreadsheet with the On
the Rise leadership team for review. She provides you the team emails and you invite each
member, assigning them commenter permission only.
Leadership team members access the spreadsheet and leave numerous comments. They also
assign action items for Sherrie West and Thomas Omar.
Complete the following steps:
1. Share the spreadsheet with the leadership team (choose another colleague, and let
them know as before that you are undertaking a training exercise) with commenter
permission. To share silently, you can uncheck the Notify people box when sharing.
2. Leave at least two general comments.
3. Assign an action item to yourself or one of your collaborators.

Task 8

The next day, Sherrie reviews the feedback she received. She notes that she needs to make a
few updates to the spreadsheet and asks for your help responding to the leadership team.
Complete the following steps:
1. Select Open comment history in the top right to easily view comments.
2. Reply to one of the comments with a “thank you.”
3. Delete one of the comments.
4. Resolve a comment.
5. Mark an action item as done.
6. Link to a comment by @mentioning your colleague in your reply.

   
Case wrap-up

Sitting at her desk, Sherrie opens her laptop and reviews the final version of her spreadsheet
“On the Rise employee openings - North America - East region”. She reflects on using Google
Sheets and working collaboratively with her team. She was able to transform the numbers
coming in from the stores across the North America - East region into practical insights. She
and the On the Rise leadership can use these insights to help guide their recruitment efforts.
Sherrie notes that this approach has been so successful it should be applied in other regions.
The team can then proactively support the human resources needs of On the Rise.
